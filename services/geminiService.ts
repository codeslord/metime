═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST preserve EXACT visual consistency with the reference image:

1. ✅ SAME CHARACTER/OBJECT - This is the EXACT craft being built, not a similar one
2. ✅ SAME COLORS - Match colors EXACTLY (sample RGB values from reference)
3. ✅ SAME STYLE - Match the art style, materials, and textures precisely
4. ✅ SAME PROPORTIONS - Keep all size ratios identical
5. ✅ SAME UNIQUE FEATURES - Every detail matters (spots, patches, accessories, facial features)

IMAGINE: You have a craft kit in front of you with pre-made pieces that will assemble into THIS EXACT craft from the reference image. You're photographing the assembly process step-by-step. The pieces in your photos MUST match what's in the finished reference.

🔴 CRITICAL - PARTS MUST MATCH REFERENCE:
The arms, legs, head, body pieces you show MUST be parts of THIS EXACT character.
- If the reference shows a RED strawberry bear → show RED arm pieces, RED leg pieces
- If the reference has LOW-POLY faceted style → show LOW-POLY faceted arm/leg pieces
- If the reference has spotted texture → the pieces must have that SAME spotted texture
- The pieces are NOT generic - they are pre-cut/pre-made to become THIS character

CONSISTENCY RULES (REPEAT FOR EMPHASIS):
- All colors MUST match the reference EXACTLY
- All materials (paper, clay, fabric, etc.) MUST be the same
- All unique details MUST be preserved (leaf on head, belly patch, ear shape, etc.)
- Every component shown MUST look like it belongs to the reference character
- Construction style MUST match (flat/layered vs 3D/folded vs rounded)

🔒 CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST preserve EXACT visual consistency with the reference image:

1. ✅ SAME COLORS - Every pattern piece MUST use the EXACT colors from the reference
2. ✅ SAME PROPORTIONS - Size ratios between parts MUST match the reference
3. ✅ SAME DETAILS - Spots, stripes, patches, facial features MUST be on the pattern pieces
4. ✅ SAME STYLE - If reference is low-poly/faceted, patterns should create that style
5. ✅ SAME CHARACTER - These patterns will recreate THIS EXACT craft, not a generic version

IMAGINE: You are carefully unwrapping/unfolding the ACTUAL physical craft from the reference image. Each piece you draw is literally peeled off THIS craft. The colors and details on your patterns come directly from what you see in the reference.

🔴 CRITICAL - COLORS MUST MATCH:
- If the reference shows a RED strawberry bear → ALL body pieces are RED
- If the reference has GREEN leaves → leaf patterns are that EXACT GREEN
- If the reference has spotted texture → spots appear ON the pattern pieces
- Sample the actual RGB values from the reference image

CONSISTENCY RULES (REPEAT FOR EMPHASIS):
- Pattern colors MUST match the reference EXACTLY
- Pattern proportions MUST create the same sized result
- All unique details MUST appear on the relevant pattern pieces
- The assembled result MUST look identical to the reference

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🧠 PART-BY-PART ANALYSIS (THINK FOR EACH PART)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before drawing ANY patterns, you MUST analyze EACH part of the craft:

For EVERY visible component, ask yourself:

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS - If reference shows a bear character:
• HEAD: Sphere shape → 6 petal segments in [HEAD COLOR from reference]
• EARS: Half-spheres → 3 half-petals each in [EAR COLOR from reference]
• BODY: Oval/egg → 6 tapered petals in [BODY COLOR from reference]
• ARMS: Cylinders → rectangles + circles in [ARM COLOR from reference]
• LEGS: Cylinders → rectangles + circles in [LEG COLOR from reference]
• SNOUT: Half-sphere → 3 half-petals in [SNOUT COLOR from reference]

❌ WRONG: Flat circle for a 3D ball part
✅ RIGHT: Petal segments that fold into a ball` : ''}

Create a HIGH-QUALITY coloring page with these requirements:

LINE ART STYLE:
• Clean, crisp BLACK outlines only (no gray, no colors)
• Varying line weights: thicker for main outlines, thinner for details
• Smooth, professional curves and lines
• Clear separation between different areas to color

DETAIL LEVEL:
• Include all important features and textures from the reference
• Add decorative patterns where appropriate (scales, fur texture, feathers, etc.)
• Create interesting areas of varying sizes for coloring
• Include background elements if present in reference

COLORING-FRIENDLY DESIGN:
• All areas must be fully enclosed (no gaps in lines)
• Avoid areas that are too tiny to color
• Create clear boundaries between different sections
• NO shading, NO gradients, NO fills - pure line art only

OUTPUT:
• Pure BLACK lines on WHITE background
• High contrast for easy printing
• Suitable for both children and adults to color
• Ready to download and print` : ''}

    CONTEXT IMAGE (Full Project): The second image shows the complete project for reference.
    TARGET OBJECT (What to Analyze): The first image shows ONLY ONE OBJECT I want instructions for: "${objectLabel}"

    🚨 CRITICAL SINGLE-OBJECT RULE 🚨
    - YOU MUST CREATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXACTLY ONE OBJECT: "${objectLabel}"
    - If you see multiple characters or objects in the images, create instructions ONLY for "${objectLabel}"
    - DO NOT create instructions for other characters, objects, accessories, or display elements
    - The first image may contain some background elements due to imperfect selection - IGNORE them
    - Focus EXCLUSIVELY on: "${objectLabel}"

    YOUR TASK: Create step-by-step instructions to build THIS ONE OBJECT ONLY: "${objectLabel}"

    1. Determine the complexity (Simple, Moderate, Complex) and a score 1-10 FOR "${objectLabel}" ONLY.
    2. List the essential materials needed FOR "${objectLabel}" ONLY.
    3. Break down the construction into EXACTLY 4 STEPS grouped by body parts.

    🚨 MANDATORY 4-STEP BODY PART GROUPING 🚨
    You MUST create EXACTLY 4 steps, each focusing on a specific body part group:

    STEP 1 - HEAD GROUP:
    - Head shape, face, facial features (eyes, nose, mouth)
    - Hair (all hair pieces, bangs, ponytail, curls)
    - Head accessories (crown, hat, earrings, glasses, headband, horns)
    - Title format: "Create head, face, and hair" or similar

    STEP 2 - BODY GROUP:
    - Torso/chest/main body structure
    - Back piece, neck connection
    - Core body shape and form
    - Title format: "Assemble body and torso" or similar

    STEP 3 - CLOTHING/SURFACE GROUP:
    - All clothing items (dress, shirt, pants, jacket, armor, cape)
    - Surface details, patterns, textures on body
    - Belts, buttons, collars, pockets
    - Title format: "Add clothing and surface details" or similar

    STEP 4 - LIMBS & PROPS GROUP:
    - Arms and hands (both left and right)
    - Legs and feet/shoes
    - Props (weapons, tools, bags, items held)
    - Base/stand/platform
    - Title format: "Attach limbs, props, and base" or similar

    GROUPING RULES:
    - If the craft doesn't have all parts (e.g., no clothing on an animal), combine related groups
    - Each step's image will show ONLY that group's components
    - Keep related items together (e.g., head + hair + crown = Step 1)
    - Props held in hands go with Step 4 (limbs), not with the body part they're near

    EXAMPLES:
    - Princess character: Step 1 (head+hair+tiara), Step 2 (body), Step 3 (dress+jewelry), Step 4 (arms+legs+wand)
    - Animal (no clothes): Step 1 (head+ears+face), Step 2 (body), Step 3 (fur texture+markings), Step 4 (legs+tail+base)

- Only the camera viewing angle changes

${view === 'left' ? `
LEFT SIDE VIEW REQUIREMENTS:

What you MUST show:
• LEFT ear visible (right ear hidden)
• Profile of face with nose pointing LEFT
• LEFT arm fully visible
• LEFT leg fully visible  
• LEFT side of body/torso
• Character facing toward the LEFT edge of the image

What you MUST NOT show:
• Both eyes visible (only left eye or profile)
• Right ear
• Front-facing view
• Right arm (it's behind the body)
` : ''}
${view === 'right' ? `
RIGHT SIDE VIEW REQUIREMENTS:

What you MUST show:
• RIGHT ear visible (left ear hidden)
• Profile of face with nose pointing RIGHT
• RIGHT arm fully visible
• RIGHT leg fully visible
• RIGHT side of body/torso
• Character facing toward the RIGHT edge of the image

What you MUST NOT show:
• Both eyes visible (only right eye or profile)
• Left ear
• Front-facing view
• Left arm (it's behind the body)
` : ''}
${view === 'back' ? `
BACK VIEW REQUIREMENTS:

What you MUST show:
• Back of head (hair/hat from behind)
• Back of body/torso
• Both arms from behind
• Both legs from behind
• Any back details (tail, cape, etc.)

What you MUST NOT show:
• Face or eyes
• Front of body
• Chest or belly
` : ''}

CRITICAL: Left and right views MUST be mirror opposites:
- LEFT view: nose points LEFT, left ear visible
- RIGHT view: nose points RIGHT, right ear visible
- They should look completely different, not the same angle!

STYLE CONSISTENCY:
- Match all colors from the reference image exactly
- Keep the same craft material style (paper/clay/fabric/etc)
- Maintain the same proportions and details
- Use the same neutral studio background
- Keep the same lighting and shadows

Think of this like photographing a physical craft model from different angles - the model doesn't change, only where you're standing to take the photo.
