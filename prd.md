Product Requirement Document (PRD): Crafternia

1. Overview

Crafternia is an "Infinite Craft Workbench" that uses Generative AI to visualize complex craft ideas and dissect them into actionable, spatial instruction cards.

The system turns a user’s idea into:

A Master Reference Image (the “truth” image of the craft).

A Material List.

A step-by-step instruction sequence.

A set of precise, isolated step-by-step images, knolled or macro, showing only the components for each step.

This resurrects the tradition of old paper instruction sheets from toy stores, sewing kits, papercraft books, and tabletop modeling — now reimagined with AI.

Tagline: Dissect your imagination. Build reality.

2. Core Features

A. Infinite Workbench (Canvas)

Technology: React Flow (infinite canvas, panning, zooming).

Style: Dark mode. Technical blueprint aesthetic (slate → indigo → emerald palette), orange yellow button colors.

Function:

Nodes represent logical objects (Master, Materials, Steps).

Users drag nodes spatially and explore the build visually.

B. Summoning (Master Image Generation)

Users describe a craft in the chat (e.g., “Papercraft fox”).

User selects a Craft Category from the sidebar:

Papercraft

Clay

Fabric / Sewing

Costume & Props

Woodcraft

Jewelry

Kids Crafts

Tabletop Figures

System uses gemini-3-pro-image-preview to create a studio-quality Master Reference Image.

The image reflects:

tangible handmade materials

neutral background

proper craft textures (foam, felt, wood grain, beads, clay, paper fibers)

clean, centered view

C. Dissection (Text Reasoning)

User clicks Dissect on the Master Node.

System uses gemini-2.5-flash to:

Analyze complexity (Simple / Moderate / Complex).

Extract materials (explicit + implied).

Generate chronological step-by-step instructions.

Return strict JSON for UI binding.

Canvas then automatically spawns:

a Materials Node

Step Nodes arranged in a grid

D. Visual Instruction Steps (Knolling Image Generation)

For each instruction step, the app asks gemini-3-pro-image-preview to generate a photorealistic, isolated step image.

Each image:

uses EXTREME ISOLATION

shows ONLY the materials or sub-components of that step

never shows the full finished object

uses knolling layout or macro close-up

matches the exact textures/colors from the Master Image

The result looks like an AI-generated IKEA manual or crafting booklet.

3. User Flow

Landing: User sees an empty dotted-grid canvas.

Prompting: User types: “Make a clay turtle.” and selects Clay category.

Master Generation: A new Master Node appears with the studio-quality image.

Dissection: User clicks Dissect → The system produces:

Materials List node

Empty Step Cards

Step Image Filling: One by one, each Step Card lights up with a category-specific step image (generated live).

User Interaction: User can reposition nodes, inspect steps, zoom, adjust.

4. AI Prompt Engineering Strategy

The app uses three core prompting stages.

Stage 1: Master Image Generation

Model: gemini-3-pro-image-preview Prompt:

Create a photorealistic studio photograph of a DIY craft project: {user_prompt}. Category: {category}. Style: Neutral background, even studio lighting, highly detailed textures showing materials such as fabric weave, paper fibers, clay surface, foam texture, wood grain, or beads. The object should look handmade and fully finished. Center the object. Do not include tools, hands, or environment. 

Stage 2: Dissection (Text Logic)

Model: gemini-2.5-flash Prompt:

You are an expert maker. Analyze this craft project described as "{user_prompt}". 1. Determine the complexity (Simple, Moderate, Complex) and a score from 1-10. 2. List all essential materials visible or implied. 3. Break down the construction into clear chronological steps. Return strict JSON matching this schema: { ...schema_definition... } 

Stage 3: Step Image Generation

Model: gemini-3-pro-image-preview

Structure:

Same PRD structure → but now with category-specific visual rules.
