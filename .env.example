# Crafternia Environment Variables

# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# The Gemini API key is currently exposed in the client-side bundle.
# For production, implement a backend proxy to protect the API key.

# Gemini API Key (for development only)
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Recommended Production Architecture:
# 1. Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., /api/generate)
# 2. Store API key server-side only
# 3. Implement rate limiting per user/IP
# 4. Add authentication/authorization
# 5. Use environment-specific keys (dev/staging/prod)
